	<h1>Non-fiction review</h1>
	
	<p><b>Yes: The Radical Case for Scottish Independence</b> (James Foley and Peter Ramand) Entertainingly written, this book show's off the authors' visceral dislike of neoliberalism and capitalism. The arguments are often non-sensical and their opinions of the status-quo delusional. Perhaps my favourite quote is "An independent treasury, no matter how incompetent, would make better use of Scotland's offshore resources." Confusingly, the book doesn't even seem to try and justify Scottish independence, instead aligning Scots politics with British politics.  </p>

	<p><b>North Korea Journal</b> (Michael Palin) That the 170 page book can be read in just a few hours is a compliment - Palin knows not to spread butter too thin over too much bread. </p>
	
	<p><b>This is Going to Hurt</b> (Adam Kay) Funny, but having heard that Dr. Kay isn't terribly nice in person, I officially dislike the book. </p>
	
	<p><b>The End of Alchemy</b> (Mervyn King) Synopsis: central bankers cannot predict the future and people and institutions follow the incentives given to them by the system within which they are placed. </p>
	
	<p><b>Women and Power: A Manifesto</b> (Mary Beard) Missing the manifesto? Really a list of grievances. </p>
	
	<p><b>Empathy</b> (Roman Krznaric) So poorly written and argued that Roman only lends credence to <i> Against Empathy</i>. A literate parrot would be capable of spotting the self-contradictions and straw-man arguments nestled within the text. </p>
	
	<p><b>Against Empathy</b> (Paul Bloom) Convincing partially because of the self critical nature of the book. The author is writing to change the minds of those who disagree rather than to please those who already share his thoughts. </p>
	
	<p><b>The Slow Death of Europe</b> (Douglas Murray) Surprisingly dependent on anecdote and "obvious" fact for a book that so readily criticises opposing work for lack of thoroughness. Murry blames the (supposed) fracturing of European unity on the (dis)integration of migrants, largely ignoring other problems. </p>

	<p><b>Failure is not an option</b> (Gene Kranz) The autobiography of a man central to the early American manned space program. The content could have been spread twice as thin and remain entertaining. </p>
	
	<p><b>Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race</b> (Reni Eddo-Lodge) Starting as you mean to continue - with content follows the inflammatory tone of the title. Worth reading none the less. </p>
