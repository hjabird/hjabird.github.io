	<h1>Arts review</h1>
	
	<p><h2>Small Island</h2>
	<i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 29/07/2019 </i>
	<br>A heavy story thoughtfully entwined with well judged humour, such that what could have been a bitter taste is not only palatable, but delicious. The writing is tight, giving the impression that every action and every line of the play was agonised over, having to earn its place in the final cut. The sets were minimal but dynamic, making excellent use of the Olivier's drum revolve and machinery to lift and lower both elements of the set and characters into and out of the scene. And the acting was pleasing and convincing, with credit going to whoever it was responsible for ensuring that accents sounded Jamaican whilst remaining easily understandable. Well written, well produced and very much recommended. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Rutherford and Son</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 29/06/2019</i>
	<br>Atmospheric and beautifully acted. In particular, Roger Allam as John Rutherford stands out. The fly is however the lack of redeeming features of a main character. Not quite fulfilling its potential, but very enjoyable none the less. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Mixed programme: The Firebird, A Symphony in C, A Month in the Country</h2><i>The Royal Ballet, The Royal Opera House, London, 07/06/2019</i>
	<br> An impressive display of what I imagine ballet to be, but lacking in humour compared to some of Scottish Ballet's productions. The raw scale of <i>The Firebird</i>'s production was impressive, but some of this might have been lost on me, so high up I was sat and so used to the Royal National Theatre's expansive casts as I am. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Man of La Mancha</h2><i>English National Opera, London Coliseum, London, 05/06/2019</i>
	<br> Oddly, so many musicals seem to compromise on the quality of the music and singing. Not this. Nor does the cast lack acting skill. Whilst Kelsey Grammar as Don Quixote managed to play with the emotions, it was Cassidy Janson as Dulcinea who exceeded what I thought was possible with respect to sticking to character whilst singing. Fantastic. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Kinky Boots</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 13/05/2019</i>
	<br> A story, the trajectory of which knows no hiccup or speedbump that lasts longer than a single song, sung through the noses of actors trying to navigated a spectacle worthy set. Relies on bright lights and loud noises to dazzle the audience. Disappointing. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Top Girls</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 20/04/2019</i>
	<br> Often confusing, at times rambling, sometimes shouty. <i>Top Girls</i> largely depends upon controversial topics instead of story - something that gets tiring quickly. The sets are impressive, and one interview scene in the middle of the play provides a humourous distraction, even if it feels somewhat separate from the rest of the production. Disappointing. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Mixed Programme: Spring! Dextera and Elite Syncopations</h2><i>Scottish Ballet, Theatre Royal, Glasgow, 04/04/2019</i>
	<br> Dextera: Like being high, addiction included. Elite Syncopations: the methadone to Dextera's heroin. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Katya Kabanova</h2><i>Scottish Opera, Theatre Royal, Glasgow, 12/03/2019</i>
	<br>My first opera. Somewhat slow to start, but by midway through the tension is such that
	the interval feels like a much needed opportunity to relax, and the second half feels cruelly 
	short. Enjoyable, but I'm lacking other operas to compare this too. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Tartuffe</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 09/03/2019</i>
	<br> Funny. And very comical. Well acted and - lets not forget - amusing. Chances are it'll make a mockery of you in some form, but the hardship is worth it to enjoy the mockery of other "types". At any rate, the false perspective of the set puts the audience in the correct frame of mind from the off. It'll be a while before I see anything that funny again. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Follies</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 23/02/2019</i>
	<br> A spectacle and strong feelings, but rather hollow with respect to story. Given the enormity of set, the size of the cast and the care that evidently went into the production, I'm astounded by how little I remember.</p>
	
	<p><h2>Hadestown</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 27/12/2018</i>
	<br>A musical retelling of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. One cannot help but be impressed by
	the singing, the sets and the atmosphere. The National Theatre manage to make their expansive 
	Olivier theatre's stage feel claustrophobic and hot or expansive and cold through the use
	of rather remarkable lighting. That said, the sound never seemed quite right, always sounding 
	as if it were playing through a sound system. Perhaps if this had not been the case, I would
	have agreed with <i>Vogue</i>'s statement that "<i>Hadestown</i> will be your next musical theatre
	obsession".
	</p>
	
	<p><h2>Cinderella</h2><i>Scottish Ballet, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, 12/12/2018</i>
	<br>
	Does Cinderella have licencing terms that require that advertising be light blue
	and include a clock? Because Scottish Ballet's advertising was remarkably similar to
	that for a Glasgow pantomime. Other similarities include a dearth of children. 
	That isn't to say that <i>Cinderella</i> was bad. No, imagine Disney-esque Cinderella,
	with tutu and an expansive set. The ugly sisters provided a humourous break
	from elegance et al.</p>
	
	<p><h2>A Christmas Carol</h2><i>Citizens Theatre Productions, Tramway, Glasgow, 08/12/2018</i>
	<br>
	Unbeknownst to me, this was a production aimed largely at children. However, with the exception of a sing-along at the very beginning, the play didn't engage in any panto-like activity, instead proving atmospheric and intimate, and showcasing an impressive menagerie of puppets. In the words of Miss Trunchbull, too good for children! </p>
	
	<p><h2>Common</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 17/06/2018</i>
	<br>
	Parishioners with Pitchforks are perturbed by a woman who will do what is necessary to get what she wants. Entertaining in passing. 
	</p>
	
	<p><h2>Salome</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 05/06/2018</i>
	<br>
	The poor naked actress on the stage must be awfully chilly, and I can't imagine what she does if her grandparents wanted to see the play. Apart from that, I can't remember much.
	</p>
	
	<p><h2>Bright Colours Only</h2><i>Citizens Theatre Productions, Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, 02/05/2018</i>
	<br>
	About Irish Catholic funeral wakes. An alarmingly intimate production, that starts with a hug, a slice of cake and a small portion of whisky. The actors spend as much time following the humourous script as they do improvising to ensure the audience feel just mildly uncomfortable. More of an experience than a play.
	</p>
	
	<p><h2>Highland Fling</h2><i>Scottish Ballet, Theatre Royal, Glasgow, 07/04/2018</i>
	<br> Dark and funny, upsetting but pleasing. An original production by Scottish Ballet, starts off as fun and games, sex and drugs, but descends to something deeper, darker and more unpleasant. Worth seeing for both the highs and the lows. </p>
	
	<p><h2>The Nutcracker</h2><i>Scottish Ballet, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, 09/12/2017</i>
	<br> A ballet designed to delight five year old girls delights me too. The beginning is most entertaining, with the Aunts providing the most character. The second half, a series of dances are performed for Clara. The dances are fun, but become a little repetitive. Overall, an enjoyable display, but its a little perplexing that this such a very popular ballet to perform. </p>
	
	<p><h2>John</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 20/12/2014</i>
	<br>
	Plunging head-first into the world of men - naked - in gyms. Of discovering a sexuality you have trouble accepting. And, later, into the kind of unhappy ending that perversely seems to characterise "adult" theatre. </p>
	
	<p><h2>King Lear</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 02/07/2014</i>
	<br> Who wants to be spat on by Simon Russel Beale? How about seeing an eye being ripped out, or madness? Memorable as hell (written 2019) - far better than the Globe's 2017 production.</p>
	
	<p><h2>Treasure Island</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 27/06/2014</i>
	<br> 50% Nice play, 50% an impressive demonstration of the Olivier Theatre's drum revolve. And I remember the revolve more.</p>
	
	<p><h2>The Light Princess</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 28/12/2013</i>
	<br> A cornerstone of the play is the propensity of the princess to float into the air in a truly mesmerising fashion. And like the Lion King, at times it sucks all joy from the audience. I want to say this play was average, but I can't help but love it. </p>
	
	<p><h2>Romeo and Juliet</h2><i>National Theatre Productions, National Theatre, London, 18/08/2013</i>
	<br> Fun and forgettable.</p>
